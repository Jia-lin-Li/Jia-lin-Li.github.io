I am a Postdoc Research Fellow in the area of [Operations Management and Statistics](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/AcademicAreas/OperationsManagement/OM_Faculty) at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, under the supervision of [Ningyuan Chen](http://individual.utoronto.ca/ningyuanchen/), [Ming Hu](http://individual.utoronto.ca/minghu/) and [Sheng Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/thushengliu/). I received my PhD in applied math ([AMSC](https://amsc.umd.edu/) program) from the University of Maryland, College Park. I was fortunate to be advised by [Ilya Ryzhov](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/iryzhov/home). 

My research interest broadly lies in (i) understanding unexpected market outcomes narrated with estimation and inference involving insufficient observational data, and (ii) developing methodologies for better decision-making under uncertainty through improved data utilization, with both topics covering applications with the theme of societal good such as problems in privacy and medical experimental design. Technically, my research is positioned at the interface of stochastic modeling, statistical learning, and applied probability.

**I am on the 2023-2024 job market.**
