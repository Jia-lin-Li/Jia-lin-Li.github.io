I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.   Previously I was a Postdoc Research Fellow in the area of [Operations Management and Statistics](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/AcademicAreas/OperationsManagement/OM_Faculty) at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, under the supervision of [Ningyuan Chen](http://individual.utoronto.ca/ningyuanchen/), [Ming Hu](http://individual.utoronto.ca/minghu/) and [Sheng Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/thushengliu/). I received my PhD in applied math ([AMSC](https://amsc.umd.edu/) program) from the University of Maryland, College Park. I was fortunate to be advised by [Ilya Ryzhov](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/iryzhov/home). 

My research focuses on developing methodologies for better decision-making under uncertainty. I seek methods that are both effective and user-friendly, and I am interested in scenarios where intuitive methods might lead to unintended negative outcomes. I am motivated by applications that have a positive societal impact. Technically, my interests include stochastic optimization, uncertainty quantification, and statistical learning.
