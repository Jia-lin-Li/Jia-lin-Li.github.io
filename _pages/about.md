I am a Postdoc Research Fellow in the area of [Operations Management and Statistics](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/AcademicAreas/OperationsManagement/OM_Faculty) at the [Joseph L. Rotman School of Management](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I received my PhD in applied math ([AMSC](https://amsc.umd.edu/) program) from [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/).

My diverse research is positioned at the interface of applied probability, operations research, statistical learning and stochastic modeling. I have primarily focused on the fundamental theory of global optimization and tensor decomposition algorithms. Since I explored more applied topics during my postdoc, now my interests also encompass business problems like data-driven revenue management.
