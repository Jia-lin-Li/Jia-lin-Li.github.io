I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Previously I was a Postdoc Research Fellow in the area of Operations Management and Statistics at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, under the supervision of [Ningyuan Chen](http://individual.utoronto.ca/ningyuanchen/), [Ming Hu](http://individual.utoronto.ca/minghu/) and [Sheng Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/thushengliu/). I received my PhD in applied math ([AMSC](https://amsc.umd.edu/) program) from the University of Maryland, College Park. I was fortunate to be advised by [Ilya Ryzhov](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/iryzhov/home). 

My research focuses on stochastic black-box models, uncertainty modeling and quantification, and statistical learning. I look for new perspectives at the intersection of statistics and operations research.
